# üîç FreeRTOS Debug Using Tracealyzer

This repository demonstrates how to integrate and use **Tracealyzer** for debugging and analyzing **FreeRTOS**-based embedded systems. Tracealyzer provides a visual timeline of your system's behavior, making it easier to identify and fix issues like task starvation, priority inversion, and CPU overuse.

## üìå Introduction

Debugging real-time systems with traditional tools (breakpoints, print logs) often misses timing-related problems. **Tracealyzer**, developed by Percepio, solves this by giving a **graphical view of FreeRTOS runtime**‚Äîincluding task execution, context switches, interrupts, queues, semaphores, and more.

With Tracealyzer, developers can:
- View detailed **task execution traces**
- Analyze **CPU utilization and load**
- Detect **bottlenecks, deadlocks**, and **priority issues**
- Optimize **real-time performance**

## üß∞ Requirements

- **FreeRTOS** (v10.x or compatible)
- **Tracealyzer SDK** from [Percepio](https://percepio.com/)
- **Microcontroller or board** (e.g., STM32, ESP32)
- Optional: **SEGGER J-Link**, **UART**, or **RTT** interface for live streaming
